# Glitch Game
Not really sure what this will turn into, but for now I'm just learning some OpenGL and playing around with some lower-level programming.

Current ideas:
- A 3D fighting game
    - I love the freedom/expressiveness of the movement in Super Smash Bros. and I don't think it's really been matched in 3 dimensions. I enjoyed playing games like Pokken and Absolver but the movement always felt somewhat restrictive. I'm considering trying to experiment with this.
- A 3D exploration game
    - One of my goals with this is to play more with lower level programming and make something beautiful. The field of programming art is a totally unexplored terrain for me and I think it'd be a lot of fun and a lot of learning to make a game *worth* exploring. To make something like this, I imagine it will force me to operate under some constraints I haven't dealt with much in programming for school, work, or other side projects.

Progress
- 9.4.22
